NumberSystems

This projects consists of doubly-linked data structures to store numbers of any number system (e.g. binary, hexadecial, decimal, etc.).

- Digit.java represents one digit of a number.
- DLNode.java represents one of the nodes in the doubly-linked list created in the LinkedNumber class.
- LinkedNumber.java represents a positive whole number of any number system (from base 2 to base 16) stored in a doubly linked list such that each digit of the number is stored in a separate node.
- LinkedNumberException.java represents an exception that relates to an invalid condition or operation while working with the LinkedNumber objects.
